<h1> MY FAVOURITE MOVIES </h1>

<h2>TOP 3 BEST MOVIES (MUST WATCH)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.Incredibles</h3>
<p>My first animation movie i have watched. It is more
    fun to rewatch it with your kids. loved the family with
superpowers.It captures the essence of classic superhero stories, while also introducing concepts that would be touched on in future ones. "With great power, comes great responsibility" is Spider-Man's famous creed, and the characters of "The Incredibles" embody this as well.</p>

<h3>2.World War Z</h3>
<p>Watched it during the pandemic. very intense.It's a solid film , a terror story plenty of suspense , restless horror, and including a lot of CGI with state-of-art special effects . 
    I couldnt take of my eyes for a minute</p>

<h3>3. Train to Busan </h3>   
<p>It is an urealistic zombie movie makes you wonder about if there are any!Train to Busan is a gorgeous zombie movie, that is shot to perfection. The film uses many wide-angle shots outside the train, as well as many close-up shots in the train to add to the sense of claustrophobia.</p>
